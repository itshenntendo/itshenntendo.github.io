## Welcome to my website...

Hello, I am Henry. A developer from England. I am currently working on two apps for iOS.

### Current Projects..

theChef is an app for iOS that has meals created by chefs, with properly detailed recipies and photos. As well as this, there will be detailed videos made by kind, loving chefs designed to help teach your to make healthy, balenced meals.

I'm also working on thePlanets. It is a basic app designed to teach young children basic facts about the planets. With basic big buttons, and pictures of the planets.

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/itshenntendo/itshenntendo.github.io/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
